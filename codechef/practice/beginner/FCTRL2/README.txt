*** Solution **
1. src1 contains 
	factorial, 
	bucket sort 
	and swapping.
2. src2 contains 
	memoization for factorials
	execution time details
3. src3 contains
	convert int to string.
	multiply big numbers using string
4. src 5 contains
	right logic for factorials.
	Takes the numbers, sorts and then outputs the bulk factorials
5. src6 contains
	No sorting. Outputs the result after each number.
